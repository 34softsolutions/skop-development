 Yes, I had quoted you 15 hours with a rough estimate, In which I aggred with install WordPress & configure theme with dummy content, I didn't quoted you for pulling the content on the website because generally all client put their content on the website itself that's why people prefer website in any CMS (like wordpress) so they can mange the all things from admin easily. But I placed the all content & images as well on the website. Once I had setup the website with dummy conent then Sonal come with their dummy text & placeholder images after the we placed the real images & content, so these all things took time. As you said the I made many mistakes so I'd like to let you know the font issue I'had fixed without billied you, Sonal sent me doc with content & I put the content on the website after that she noticed many spelling mistakes in that content so it was not my fault she has to cross check the all content before sending me. In our skype convesation most of time Sonal says to do one things in couple of time with different different style because She wanted to see how it will look like & then she final the page layout and I did as she said. I am not saying that you or Sonal were wrong, I am just try explain how things were going with me that's why its took too long. Most of time I didn't billed you and make lot of small things without any billing if I billed you all the time when I was working for you then it will take more than34 hrs.I am going to mention the thigns that I have done in these 34 Hrs.
